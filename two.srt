1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:19,350
this is a day I've been looking forward
to for two and a half years every once

2
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,730
in a while a revolutionary product comes
along that changes everything

3
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,840
and Apple has been well first of all
ones very fortunate if you get to work

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,340
on just one of these in your career
apples been very fortunate it's been

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:49,079
able to introduce a few of these into
the world 1984 we introduced the

6
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,449
Macintosh it didn't just change Apple it
changed the whole computer industry

7
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:17,190
in 2001 we introduced the first iPod and
it didn't just it didn't just change the

8
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:26,600
way we all listen to music it changed
the entire music industry well today

9
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:38,600
we're introducing three revolutionary
products of this class the first one is

10
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,729
a widescreen iPod with touch controls

11
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:59,300
the second is a revolutionary mobile

12
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:20,959
and the third is a breakthrough internet
communications device so three things a

13
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,550
widescreen iPod with touch controls a
revolutionary mobile phone and a

14
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:37,050
breakthrough internet communications
device an iPod a phone and an Internet

15
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:44,330
communicator an iPod a phone

16
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:57,069
these are not three separate devices
this is one device

17
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,740
and we are calling it iPhone

18
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,700
today
today Apple is going to reinvent the

19
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:18,870
phone and here it is

20
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,130
No

21
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,989
actually here it is but we're gonna
leave it there for now so before we get

22
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,380
into it

23
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,709
let me let me talk about a category of
things the most advanced phones are

24
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:45,120
called smart phones so they say and they
typically combine a phone plus some

25
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,219
email capability plus they say it's the
internet or the baby internet into one

26
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,379
device and they all have these plastic
little keyboards on them and the problem

27
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,859
is that they're not so smart and they're
not so easy to use so if you kind of

28
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:06,870
make a you know business school 101
graph with a smart axis and the easy to

29
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,950
use axis follows regular cell phones are
kind of right there they're not so smart

30
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:17,070
and they're you know not so easy to use
but smart phones are definitely a little

31
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,229
smarter but they actually are harder to
use they're really complicated just for

32
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,789
the basic stuff people have a hard time
figuring out how to use them well we

33
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,780
don't want to do either one of these
things what we want to do is make a

34
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,419
leapfrog product that is way smarter
than any mobile device has ever been and

35
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:47,580
super easy to use this is what iPhone is
okay we're gonna reinvent the phone now

36
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:59,760
we're gonna start with a revolutionary
user interface is the result of years of

37
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,880
research and development and of course
it's an interplay of hardware and

38
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,530
software now why do we need a
revolutionary user interface I mean

39
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,800
here's four smartphones right Motorola
cue the BlackBerry Palm Treo nokia e62

40
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,169
the usual suspects and what's wrong with
their user interfaces well the problem

41
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,820
with them is really sort of in the
bottom 40 they're it's it's this stuff

42
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,919
right here they all have these keyboards
that are there whether you need them or

43
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,570
not to be there and they all have these
control buttons that are fixed in

44
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,740
plastic and are the same for every
application well every application wants

45
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,689
a slightly different user interface a
slightly optimized set of buttons just

46
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:49,739
for it and what happens if you think of
a great idea six months from now you

47
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:53,309
can't run around and add a button to
these things they're already shipped so

48
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:58,499
what do you do it doesn't work because
the buttons and the controls can't

49
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:03,299
change they can't change for each
application and they can't change down

50
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:06,649
the road if you think of another great
idea you want to add to this product

51
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:12,749
well how do you solve this hmm
it turns out we have solved it we solved

52
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:18,659
it in computers 20 years ago we solved
it with a bitmap screen that could

53
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:25,169
display anything we want put any user
interface up and a pointing device we

54
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,759
solved it with the mouse right we solve
this problem so how are we gonna take

55
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,619
this to a mobile device but what we're
gonna do is get rid of all these buttons

56
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:42,779
and just make a giant screen a giant
screen now how are we gonna communicate

57
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,019
this we don't want to carry around a
mouse right so what are we gonna do

58
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:52,279
Oh a stylus right we're gonna use a
stylus No

59
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,689
who wants a stylus you have to get them
and put them away and you'll lose them

60
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:01,139
yuck
nobody wants a stylus so let's not use a

61
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,459
stylus we're going to use the best
pointing device in the world we're gonna

62
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,149
use a pointing device that we're all
born with were born with ten of them

63
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:13,169
we're gonna use our fingers we're going
to touch us with our fingers and we have

64
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:19,439
invented a new technology called
multi-touch which is phenomenal it works

65
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:27,569
like magic you don't need a stylus it's
far more accurate than any touch display

66
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:34,259
that's ever been shipped it ignores
unintended touches it's super smart you

67
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:40,909
can do multi-finger gestures on it and
boy have we patented it

68
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:53,910
so we've been very lucky to have brought
a few revolutionary user interfaces to

69
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:00,510
the market in our time
first was the mouse the second was the

70
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,240
click wheel and now we're gonna bring
multi-touch to the market and each of

71
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,490
these revolutionary user interfaces has
made possible a revolutionary product

72
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,840
the Mac the iPod and now the iPhone so a
revolutionary user interface we're gonna

73
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:27,090
build on top of that with software now
software on mobile phones is like it's

74
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:33,539
like baby software it's not so powerful
and today we're gonna show you a

75
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,460
software or breakthrough software that's
at least five years ahead of what's on

76
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,060
any other phone now how do we do this
well we start with a strong foundation

77
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,410
iPhone runs OS 10

78
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,140
why
why would we want to run such a

79
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,790
sophisticated operating system on a
mobile device well because it's got

80
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,110
everything we need
it's got multitasking it's got the best

81
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,430
networking it already knows how to power
manage we've been doing this on mobile

82
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,800
computers for years it's got awesome
security and the right apps it's got

83
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,110
everything from cocoa and the graphics
and it's got core animation built in and

84
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,209
it's got the audio and video that OS 10
is famous for it's God all the stuff we

85
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:33,680
want and it's built right in to iPhone
and that has led us create desktop class

86
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,860
applications and networking right not
the crippled stuff that you find on most

87
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,100
phones this is real desktop class
applications now you know one of the

88
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,510
pioneers of our industry Alan Kay has
had a lot of great quotes throughout the

89
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,120
years and I ran across one of them
recently that explains how we look at

90
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,180
this explains why we go about doing
things the way we do because we love

91
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:08,850
software and here's the quote people who
are really serious about software should

92
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,800
make their own hardware you know Alan
said this thirty years ago

93
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,410
and this is how we feel about it and so
we're bringing breakthrough software to

94
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,940
a mobile device for the first time it's
five years ahead of anything on any

95
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,130
other phone the second thing we're doing
is we're learning from the iPod syncing

96
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,560
with iTunes you know we're gonna ship
our hundred millionth iPod this year and

97
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,390
that's a tens of millions of people that
know how to sync these devices with

98
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:45,270
their PCs or Mac and sync all of their
media right onto their iPod right so you

99
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,560
just drop your iPod in and it
automatically syncs you're gonna do the

100
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,690
same thing with iPhone it automatically
syncs to your PC or Mac right through

101
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,670
iTunes and iTunes is going to sync all
your media onto your iPhone your music

102
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:05,640
your audio books podcasts movies TV
shows music videos but it also syncs a

103
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,230
ton of data your contacts your calendars
photos which you can get on your iPod

104
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,510
today your notes your your bookmarks
from your web browser your email

105
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,990
accounts your whole email setup all that
stuff can be moved over to iPhone

106
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,420
completely automatically it's really
nice and we do it we do it through

107
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,880
iTunes again you go to iTunes and you
set it up just like you'd set up an iPod

108
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,399
or an Apple TV and you set up what you
want sync to your iPhone and it's just

109
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:43,440
like an iPod charge and sync
so sync with iTunes third thing I want

110
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,329
to talk about a little is design we've
designed something wonderful for your

111
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:56,160
hand just wonderful and this is what it
looks like it's got a three-and-a-half

112
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,829
inch screen on it it's really big and
it's the highest resolution screen we've

113
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:04,589
ever shipped it's a hundred and sixty
pixels per inch

114
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:09,600
highest we've ever shipped it's gorgeous
and on the front there's only one button

115
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,380
down there we call it the home button it
takes you home from wherever you are and

116
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,639
that's it
let's take a look aside it's really thin

117
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,350
it's thinner than any smartphone out
there at eleven point six millimeters

118
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,540
thinner than the Q thinner than the
Black Jack thinner than all of them it's

119
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,560
really nice and we got some controls on
the side we got a little switch for ring

120
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,410
and silent we've got a volume up and
down control let's look at the back on

121
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,350
the back the biggest thing of note is we
got a two megapixel camera built right

122
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:47,339
in the other side and we're back on the
front so let's take a look at the top

123
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:52,829
now we've got a headset jack
three-and-a-half millimeter all your

124
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:57,540
iPod headphones fit right in we've got a
place a little tray for your SIM card

125
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,399
and we've got one switch for sleeping
wake just push it to go to sleep push it

126
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:09,810
to wake up let's take a look at the
bottom we've got a speaker you've got a

127
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:17,339
microphone and we've got our 30 pin iPod
connector so that's the bottom now we've

128
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,350
also got some stuff you can't see we've
got three really advanced sensors

129
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,730
built into this phone the first one is a
proximity sensor it senses when physical

130
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,020
objects get close so when you bring
iPhone up to your ear to take a phone

131
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,940
call it turns off the display and it
turns off the touch sensor instantly why

132
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,210
do you want to do that well one to save
battery but - so you don't get spurious

133
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,540
inputs from your face into the touch
screen just automatically turns them off

134
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,050
take it away boom it's back on so it's
got a proximity sensor built in it's got

135
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,800
an ambient light sensor as well we sense
the ambient lighting conditions and

136
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,310
adjust the brightness of the display to
match the ambient lighting conditions

137
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,960
again better user experience saves power
and the third thing we've got is an

138
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,830
accelerometer so that we can tell when
you switch from portrait to landscape

139
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,440
it's pretty cool you show it to you in a
minute

140
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:12,720
so three advanced sensors built-in so
let's go ahead and turn it on this is

141
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,070
the size of it it fits beautifully in
the palm of your hand so an iPod phone

142
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:29,840
and an Internet communicator let's start
with the iPod you can touch your music

143
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,120
you can just touch your music it's so
cool you got a widescreen video you can

144
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,320
find your music even faster
gorgeous album art on this display

145
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:50,700
built-in speaker and why not cover flow
first time ever on an iPod and so rather

146
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,680
than talk about this some more let me
show it to you

147
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:08,530
all righty now I've got some special
special iPhones up here they've got a

148
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,920
little special board in them enough so I
can get some digital video out I got a

149
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,720
little cord here which goes up to these
projectors and so I got some great

150
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,300
images and you get to see what it really
looks like

151
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,540
so let me I've got a camera here so you
can see what I'm doing with my finger

152
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,030
for a few seconds and let me go ahead
and get that picture within picture up

153
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,200
I'm going to go ahead and just push the
sleep/wake button there we go right

154
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,960
there and to unlock the phone I just
take my finger and slide it across all

155
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,490

156
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,710

157
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,940

corner and push this icon right here and

on-screen controls

212
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,210
you know I was showing this to somebody
I was giving a demo to somebody a little

213
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,010
while ago who had never seen this before
inside Apple and I finished the demo I

214
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:36,360
said what do you think he told me this
he said you had me at school so the

215
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,100
iPhone with the most amazing iPod ever
you can now touch your music so that's

216
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,940
the iPod now let's take a look at a
revolutionary phone we want to reinvent

217
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:57,050
the phone now what's the killer app the
killer app is making calls it's amazing

218
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:02,610
it's amazing how hard it is to make
calls on most phones most people

219
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,750
actually dial them every time most
people don't have very many numbers in

220
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,800
their address book they use their
recents as their address book right how

221
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,780
many of you do that I bet more than a
few so we want to let you use contacts

222
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,700
like never before you can sync your
iPhone with your PC or Mac and bring

223
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,170
down all your contacts right into your
phone so you've got everybody's numbers

224
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,630
with you at all times we have something
that's going to revolutionize voicemail

225
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,520
today we call it visual voicemail
wouldn't it be great if you didn't if

226
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,580
you had six voicemails if you didn't
have to listen to five of them first

227
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,520
before you wanted to listen to the sixth
will not be great if you have

228
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,190
random-access voicemail well we've got
it just like email you can go directly

229
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,220
to the voicemails that interest you
excellent all of the audio quality

230
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:59,150
iPhone is a quad-band GSM + H phone we
have decided

231
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,990
we've decided to go with the most
popular international standard which is

232
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,900
GSM we're on that bandwagon headed on
that roadmap and plan to make 3G phones

233
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,880
and all sorts of other amazing things in
the future so quad bad gsm plus h and of

234
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:23,730
course we have Wi-Fi and bluetooth 2.0
EDR built-in as well and so this is what

235
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:28,380
it looks like when you get a call this
is what it sounds like it's one of our

236
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:37,410
ringtones you can pick of course so I
want to show you four things I want to

237
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:46,500
show you the phone app photos got a
calendar and SMS messaging the kind of

238
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,380
things you would find on a typical phone
but in a very untypical way now so let's

239
00:24:52,380 --> 00:25:04,110
go ahead take a look so let's go to our
phone first you see that icon in the

240
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,820
lower left-hand corner the phone I just
push it right here and boom I'm in the

241
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,140
phone and I've got five buttons across
the bottom favorites recents contacts

242
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,950
keypad and voicemail I'm in contacts
right now again how do I move around my

243
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:22,230
contacts I just scroll through them and
so let's say I want to make a call to

244
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,120
Johnny I've I can just push here and I
see Johnny Ives context with all his

245
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,830
information his three phone numbers his
email whatever else is address whatever

246
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,140
else I've got it's all in one place and
if I want to call Johnny all I do is

247
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,730
push his phone number I'll call his
mobile number right now and now we are

248
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:52,820
calling Johnny here it turned on a
speaker phone like this if I wanted to

249
00:25:52,820 --> 00:26:00,210
hey Johnny how you doing well it's been
two and a half years and I can't tell

250
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:06,260
you how thrilled I am to make the first
public phone call with iPhone

251
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,639
I I remember when we first started
working on this and it's just it's just

252
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:22,789
unbelievable whoa whoa what is this I've
got another call coming in Johnny can I

253
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:33,979
put you on hold for a minute okay so I
put Johnny on hold and hi Phil all right

254
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:37,489
Phil as you can see it's put it's put

the button has changed to merge calls

257
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:54,409
right there in the middle so I just push
that right here and now I've created a

258
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:57,009
conference call

259
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:11,360

262
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:26,280

Phil on hold Johnny do you have anything

263
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:34,950

too shabby

264
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,870

all righty

267
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:58,630
so
now I've also got a way to make a list

268
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,080
of favorites here from my most often
called numbers so I can just touch it

269
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,220
once and dial dial the number and I
might want to add somebody to favor it

273
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,340
let's say I want to put Phil's work
number and it's added Phil right there

274
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,340
you can see the favorites I can edit
favorites by pushing the edit button in

275
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,060
the upper left-hand corner and I can
move Phil up if I want to you know maybe

276
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:36,670
the top and let's say I'm not gonna you
know type Tony's changed his number I

277
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,400
got to update this anyway so I'm gonna
get rid of that and I could just remove

278
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,780
Tony boom there we go it's that simple
to edit these things very very easy

279
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,160
I've got recents right here which is all
my recent phone calls if I want to see

280
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,160
the ones I've missed which you're in red
I can just go up and touch that button

281
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,930
at the top and boom those are all the
ones I've missed and those are all the

282
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:01,480
calls that I've placed or have done if I
want to dial the phone if I'm real last

283
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,440
century
I can push keypad here and I can dial a

284
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,890
call just with oops called for sorry
wrong number

285
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:20,980
4:08 16 and it formats the numbers and
if I want to I can just keep dialing

286
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,430
let's say it's a European number and the
numbers just keep getting smaller real

287
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:29,950
simple very simple to that with a keypad
now let me show you visual voicemail

288
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:36,190
this is so cool this is a collaboration
that we've done which I'll talk more

289
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:43,300
about later and it allows us to have
random access voicemail go directly to

290
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,540
the voicemails we want so as an example
I come to my voicemail I know there's

291
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:53,860
one by Al Gore I want to hear that one I
just push it I'm here in Nashville

292
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:59,260
training people to give my slide show
but I wanted to say congratulations on

293
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:04,890
the iPhone it is unbelievably cool good
luck with the presentation call me later

294
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,890
now if I want to call al back right now
I can just push that callback button

295
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,830
but I want to listen to one from Tim
Cook I got here so let me listen to Tim

296
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:18,070
Davis Tim I've got the results for last
quarter revenue was if you know I'll

297
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:27,190
just wait and tell you what you get it
first and as awesome and so I've got

298
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,510
voicemail how I want to listen to it
when I want to listen to it in any order

299
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:37,420
I want to listen to it with visual
voicemail so that is a quick tour of the

300
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:43,330
phone app now what I want to do is show
you SMS texting so I just go to that SMS

301
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:48,429
icon in the upper left hand corner and
push it and I not only have SMS texting

302
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:54,010
but I have multiple sessions so I can be
carrying on conversations with people

303
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,940
and every time I get a new message from
them I'll be alerted to that and I can

304
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,750
go check it out so as an example here
I've got Eddy Cue and I've been carrying

305
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,440
on a conversation with Eddie and I just
tap this and here's the conversation

306
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,799
I've been carrying on right here right
and if there's a new message look at me

307
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,820
so there's a new message from Phil and
let's see the conversation was what hey

308
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,059
Steve hi
still on for dinner tonight absolutely

309
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:20,110
your turn to pick I've picked sushi Ron
how about seven o'clock tonight and I

310
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,679
said I can just say you know sounds
great I've got this little keyboard

311
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,020
which is phenomenal it does air for
prevention and correction and not that I

312
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,200
wouldn't make some I probably will but
it's actually really fast the type on

313
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,630
it's faster than all these little
plastic keyboards and all these smart

314
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,790
phones so I can just say sounds great

315
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,299
see you there

316
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:59,989
and I can send that and there it is

317
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:10,710
and when Phil messages me back I'll be
alerted I'll see the dot and I can just

318
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,349
go pick up that conversation where it
left off if I want to send a message to

319
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:17,849
Eddie I or Scott I just push this and
send a message and go it's so simple

320
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:22,289
so that's SMS messaging and you know I
again you've seen the keyboard it's

321
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:25,799
pretty awesome we'll come back to that a
little bit later and the third app I

322
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:29,039
want to show you as part of the phone
package is photos you know we have a two

323
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,389
megapixel camera built-in as I said we
also have the coolest photo management

324
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:37,200
app ever certainly on a mobile device
but I think maybe ever

325
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,460
and so here's here's our photos I'm
gonna go into our photo library and this

326
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,399
is our library and again I can just
scroll through photos here with my

327
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:50,399
finger pretty cool let me go to a photo
album I'll pick Italy and I just let's

328
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,289
start at the top and to go through
pictures I just swipe them just swipe

329
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:59,970
through my photo library oh there's one
that's this landscape I can just turn my

330
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:08,190
device and take a look at it
pretty cool huh right so I can even

331
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:14,549
swipe when I'm in landscape here you
know missile awesome the other thing I

332
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:20,039
can do is I can take any of these
pictures and I can make them bigger and

333
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,429
so let me go ahead and get the camera
back up yeah there it is right there

334
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:28,379
I can I can just take my fingers and I
can we call it the pinch I can bring

335
00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:31,409
them closer together and move them
further apart to make it bigger or

336
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:37,399
smaller and so I can just move them
further apart and stretch the image

337
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,740
and move it around

338
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,059
and now
now what I can do is I can pick to what

339
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:56,200
make this Maya wallpaper and of course I
could you know jigger it around then and

340
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:04,090
just set the wallpaper and now when I if
I'm back at home and I go to sleep when

341
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,490
I wake up from here on out until I reset
it

342
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,450
that's my wallpaper whenever I'm making
a call that's what I'm gonna see boom

343
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:19,030
there we go so photos SMS and the phone
app that is part of our phone package

344
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,200

345
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:36,720

app the ability to just take any picture
and make it your wallpaper it's pretty

349
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,870
unbelievable and I think when you have a
chance to get your hand on it you'll

350
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:09,560
agree we have reinvented the phone okay

351
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:20,370
so now let's take a look at an internet
communications device it's part of

352
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:26,150
iPhone so what's this all about well
we've got some real breakthroughs here

353
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:34,680
start off with we've got rich HTML email
on iPhone the first time really rich

354
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,590
email on a mobile device and it works
with any IMAP or pop email service you

355
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:45,300
got your favorite mail service it'll
likely work with it and it's rich text

356
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:51,210
email we wanted the best web browser in
the world on our phone not a baby web

357
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,310
browser or a WAP browser a real web
browser and we picked the best one in

358
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:02,130
the world Safari and we have Safari
running on iPhone it is the first fully

359
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:12,470
usable HTML browser on a phone third

360
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:21,790
we have Google Maps Maps satellite
images directions and traffic this is

361
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:27,080
unbelievable wait till you see it we
have widgets starting off with weather

362
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:33,740
and stocks and this communicates with
the internet over edge and Wi-Fi and

363
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,730
iPhone automatically the text Wi-Fi and
switches seamlessly to it you don't have

364
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:45,770
to manage the network it just does the
right thing now I want to take a second

365
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,510
to talk about email we hook up to almost
any IMAP or pop 3 mail service I just

366
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,960
want to give you some examples
IMAP of course is the best because you

367
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,960
can keep your folders and all your email
on the server and access it from

368
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,340
anywhere Yahoo Yahoo Mail is IMAP
Microsoft Exchange has an IMAP option

369
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,800
and obviously dot Mac mail is IMAP as
well

370
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,280
pop3 Google Gmail AOL Mail and most ISPs
are pop3 email now I want to take a

371
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,150
minute and highlight one yahoo mail
yahoo mail is the biggest mail service

372
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:27,140
in the world they have over a quarter
billion users biggest email service in

373
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,070
the world and today we are announcing
with yahoo that they are going to

374
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:40,010
provide free push IMAP email to all
iPhone customers so this isn't just IMAP

375
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,690
email it is push IMAP email so when you
get a message it'll push it right out to

376
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:50,480
the phone for you same as a blackberry
free IMAP push email from Yahoo so we

377
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,080
think this is a pretty big deal so what
I'd like to do now is I'd like to show

378
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:05,230
you mail Safari Google Maps and widgets
running on iPhone so let's go see

379
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,850
so let's go into male second icon from
the left on the bottom there I just

380
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:20,500
touch it with my finger and boom I'm
there and so I've got an inbox here and

381
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:26,980
this is by the way running live on Yahoo
IMAP email this stuff is coming off of

382
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,840
Yahoo's servers somewhere up in the
cloud

383
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,290
and so I say James Vincent here sent me
an email

384
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:40,570
he's a proud father and there we go and
I can just scroll here I've got inline

385
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:47,230
photos rich text email there we go let's
look at another one Phil Schiller she

386
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:57,280
loved the gift again inline photos rich
text pretty nice shopping list again

387
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,710
rich text right here pretty cool

388
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,000
directions to sushi Ron for tonight's
dinner now iPhone of course parses out

389
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,390
phone numbers and as you can see there's
a phone number in blue I can just touch

390
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,250
it and boom I'm gonna call this place
alright I don't really want to call him

391
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,530
so I'm gonna end the call here but you
get the idea and now this last one

392
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,580
Kember eScan is one of our marketing
folks he just returned from Antarctica

393
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:30,160
Ken's a great photographer and he took
all these great photos of of penguins in

394
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,640
Antarctica it's really cool this that's
great right in your email right on your

395
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,010
phone and if I want to by the way I can
look at my email with a split view just

396
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,640
like I do on my computer and so I can
select something here and just look at

397
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,120
it down here if I want to prove my
messages real fast and just find that

398
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,000
one message I was looking for but I
actually like the full screen view and

399
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,890
of course we have a standard inbox and
drafts and sent and you know in all

400
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,490
sorts of folders you can put things in
as well so it's real email just like

401
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:05,200
you're used to on your computer right
here on your phone it's extraordinary

402
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:14,080
and again free IMAP email from Yahoo now
let me go ahead and just create an email

403
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,260
message show you what that's like
so again when I don't need the keyboard

404
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,390
it's not there when I do it's there
want to send a message to let's say Phil

405
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,710
I just typed pH and boom Phil Schiller
its address completion and maybe I'll

406
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:32,320

00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,580
want to show you something incredible I

411
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:19,650
want to show you Safari running on a
mobile device so let's go to the web and

412
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,690
here we are I'm going to load in my
rather than Apple comm here a little

413
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,770
more Universal site I'm going to load in
the New York Times it's kind of a slow

414
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,650
site because it's got a lot of images
but here we are loading it we're loading

415
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:39,370
it over Wi-Fi right now and rather than
just give you a web version of the New

416
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:43,750
York Times rather than give you this
wrapped version all around we're showing

417
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,160
you the whole New York Times website and
there it is and guess what I can do I

418
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,200
can just put this into landscape mode
and there it is right there and I can

419
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:01,060
scroll here if I want scroll up and down
here boom still loading it in there we

420
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:06,520
go or I can just get back like this now
this is really great and I can see the

421
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,030
whole page but of course I can't read it
it's a little too small so I can get in

422
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,480
with my fingers and pinch it but we have
an optimization here I can just double

423
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,190
tap on anything and it automatically
fills up the screen with it and I can

424
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,790
just scroll around like this and scroll
over here and I can even make this text

425
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,770
bigger if I want to and there it is

426
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:38,640
and just double tap again to get back to
the full page isn't school and so I'm

427
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,910
just look at this there is the New York
Times and again any article I want boom

428
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:55,260
there we go boom unbelievable
now you can look at multiple web pages

429
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,369
as well you can have multiple web pages
open so I just push this button in the

430
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:03,809
lower right hand corner shrinks it down
and I could add a new page if I want and

431
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:08,970
I'll go to Amazon here out of my
bookmarks so let's go to Amazon and I

432
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:14,099
love to go to the DVD section of Amazon
and see what DVDs are selling I like it

433

461
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:07,760
Google Maps on iPhone I hit our Maps

464
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:22,069
I'm gonna go look for something I'm
gonna certainly want a cup of coffee

465
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:29,329
afterwards so I'm just gonna look for
Starbucks right Starbucks so I'm going

466
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:34,110
to search for Starbucks and sure enough

471
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:24,570
I can zoom in by just again pinching if
I want to or I can just double click to

472
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,190
zoom in and I get just higher and higher
resolution versions of the map so let's

473
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:33,359
go somewhere else here that I've got
bookmarked and let's go to Washington

474
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,089
monuments and so here is Washington DC

double tap in again and but now I want

477
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:50,220

478
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,339
button called satellite down at the
bottom and it's going to replace the map

479
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:58,740
with satellite images there we go
and I can just double tap in and double

Rome so again here we are in Rome that's

488
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,980
as far as we can go with the map but we
can go a little further with the

489
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,500
satellite
there's the Colosseum there's the Roman

492
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:26,210
so all these amazing things this is a
breakthrough internet communicator built

493
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:32,000
right into iphone the first rich HTML
email on a phone the first real web

Google Maps on the planet widgets and

495
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:43,100

very very happy with this again email

496
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:50,960
push email IMAP free yahoo and almost
any other IMAP and POP mail service you

497
00:49:50,960 --> 00:50:00,230
want to hook up to incredible new
technology for entering text far better

498
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,850
than we've seen on phones before a real
browser on the phone we can see real web

499
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:09,619
pages in portrait or landscape we can
zoom in on what we want to take a look

500
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:20,240
at more closely Google Maps and widgets
it's the Internet in your pockets for

501
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,290
the first time ever now
you can't you can't really think about

502
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:29,660
the Internet of course without thinking
about Google right and for Google what

503
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,170
we have on our phone working with them
is of course Google search we have that

504
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,530
built right into the browser just type
what you want hit Google and you're off

505
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:41,000
and Google Maps we've been working very
closely with them to make this all

506
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
happen
we're thrilled with the results and it's

507
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,160
my pleasure now to introduce dr. Eric
Schmidt Google's CEO

508
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:12,180
halation Steve what an incredible job so
Steve you know I've had the privilege of

509
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,960
joining joining the board and there's a
lot of relationships between the boards

510
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,369
and I thought you know if we just sort
of merge the companies we could call

511
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:28,800
them Apple goo but I'm not a marketing
guy what I like about this new device

512
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,700
and the new architecture of the Internet
is that you can actually merge without

513
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:38,099
merging Steve says that each company
should do the absolutely best thing that

514
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:43,200
they can do every time and I think he's
shown it once again today and internet

515
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:53,400
architectures right you know internet
architectures allow you now to take the

516
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,330
enormous brain trust that is represented
by the Apple development team and

517
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:02,339
combine that with the open protocols and
data services that companies like Google

518
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:07,020
and the others represented that are
coming up in in a bit to actually put

519
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,130
them together in a seamless environment
for end-users what I particularly like

520
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:15,660
about this is it's the first time it's
all to come together in one place now

521
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:21,119
from a Google perspective what we've
done is we've pushed very very hard to

522
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,750
partner with others in particular to
partner with Apple the companies the

523
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,099
cultures are similar innovation having
fun while you're doing it and also

524
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:34,440
working with many many different data
services so Steve showed a little bit of

525
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,520
some of the components some of the
pieces and so forth that you can do but

526
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,839
understand that this is a set of data
that's from maps and partners and so

527
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:46,800
forth so that you really can get the
full integration the person doesn't

528
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,320
understand how hard it was to get it all
together it comes together seamlessly

529
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:56,460
from my perspective this is the first of
a whole new generation of data services

530
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,410
where these powerful based cloud
computers Google being we hope a leading

531
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:07,290
representative provides HTML XML and
other sophisticated services that the

532
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:11,130
Safari browser that's embedded in the
iPhone and many other of its type

533
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,960
devices and future devices
Apple will be able to take advantage

534
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:21,750
Steve my congratulations to you and this
product is going to be hot

535
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:42,680
as a board member you'll get one of the
first ones yeah okay

536
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,720
now you also can't think about the
internet without thinking about Yahoo

537
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:53,000
and again on the phone we've got Yahoo
search built right in you can select

538
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,420
which one you want to use just type in
something hit that Yahoo button and boom

539
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:03,920
you're off and of course we also have
Yahoo IMAP email services and so it is

540
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:12,280
my great pleasure to introduce Jerry
Yang co-founder and chief Yahoo Jerry

541
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:25,280
thank you thank you thank you Steve I'm
not a board member of Apple but I would

542
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,319
love that one of these two obviously Wow
all this for a phone pretty incredible

543
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,060
and what a great device Steve we are
really proud at Yahoo to be partnering

544
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:40,810
with Apple on not only the Yahoo IMAP
email the first one we're doing but also

545
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:45,380
hopefully on a whole variety of other
popular services from Yahoo one of the

546
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,859
things that we're going to be doing with
Apple is also launching some of our new

547
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:52,069
services that we announced this week the
Yahoo go Yahoo

548
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:56,000
one search and hopefully we can get
Yahoo one search which is one of our new

549
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,810
products honor this phone which is a
really innovative way of looking at

550
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:03,530
search you're really able to not get the
traditional web search results but

551
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:07,819
rather get all the things you want in a
very concise format aggregated if you're

552
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:12,530
typing things like San Francisco you'll
get all the local news local weather and

553
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:17,270
local maps all in one place so we're
looking forward to doing that as Steve

554
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:22,819
said Mayo is a killer app on it on the
on the phone and Yahoo is really trying

555
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:27,619
to re design and re innovate and
reinvent the web experience and Internet

556
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:31,490
experience on the mobile devices so on
the email you can look forward not only

557
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:36,109
to great web services like the best spam
protection address books integration and

558
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:39,740
a calendar if you're on Yahoo just think
it's basically like having a blackberry

559
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:43,040
without the exchange server this is
really going to be really great not only

560
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,240
having a seamless experience from your
PC taken to your mobile internet yeah

561
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,430
there's some clapping out there I can
hear that lastly we want to be able to

562
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,270
really take what Apple is doing on the
phone by reinventing the phone and

563
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:01,430
reinventing the device we want to be
able to do that on the internet and what

564
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:06,230
we're doing is really being able to take
great form factors great user

565
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:12,380
experiences and great UI that we're
taking from not only the web but also in

566
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,190
the backend services and translate them
into a seamless web experience so we're

567
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,310
big believers and great hardware and
great software and we're big believers

568
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,450
in taking the web services and web 2.0
model and take it into the device world

569
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:28,700
so Steve my address you had it all

Google and Yahoo and we've been able to

573
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,219
work with these guys really closely and
it's been an incredible pleasure to work

everybody in iphone so thank you guys so

much you've really helped us put the
internet in your pocket so internet

576
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:17,709
communicator an iPod and a phone let's
put them all together and see what you

577
00:57:17,709 --> 00:57:27,249
can do in a real life scenario so let's
take a look I'm I want listen to some

578
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:33,699
music so I'm gonna go into my iPod here
and let's see an artist's I want to

579
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:39,489
listen to oh maybe
Red Hot Chili Peppers I love those guys

580
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:48,000
and so I'm listening to a song of theirs

581
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:56,640
and let's see what happens when I get a
phone call music fades out screen

582
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:03,660
changes phone call coming in so I can
ignore it but I think I'm gonna answer

583
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:10,830
it so I'll answer it howdy hi Phil now
knows who Phil is because he's in my

584
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,350
address book so it puts his little
picture up here and everything up there

585

587
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:34,800
here and I'm still on the call you can
see the the phone thing flashing right

588
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,000
there on the lower left and I go into
photos and now I'm in photos and again

589
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,700
you can see the bar across the top the
green bar I can just touch that to

590
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,990
return to the call and Phil wants a
photo that he wanted to use it for a

591
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,440
screen saver it was one of the ones that
was taken in Hawaii I think it was this

592
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,660
one yep there it is so you want me to
mail this to you Phil all right so I

593
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,810

button and rather than use it as

594
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:02,460
wallpaper I'm gonna email it and so
watch what happens now it shrinks it a

595
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:08,130
little bit and then a compose window
will come up right behind it there we go

596
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:13,860
and I will just tap in the to field and
send this to Phil here Phil Schiller

600
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:42,000
bookmarks here and yes I do let's go to
Fandango figure out what movies are

601
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,180
playing

602
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:50,410
don't want to read too much into it

603
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:55,250
okay here's Fandango let's just
DoubleTap and here's the movies playing

604
00:59:55,250 --> 01:00:01,790
yep how about we go see Night at the
Museum I haven't seen that yet great all

605
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,400
righty
hey take care of Phil now what I'm going

606
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,200
to do is to go back to my call I just
touch the top here and I'm back at my

607
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:16,610
call and I'm just going to go ahead and
end the call and what happens now back

608
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:19,360
in my music

609
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:35,929
so this is what it's like when you put
it all together

610
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:43,619
iPhone today Apple is reinventing the
phone now how does this stack up let's

611
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:50,339
go back to to these guys let's take a
look well these are their these are

612
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:58,079
their home screens and again as you
recall this is iPhones home screen this

613
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,899
this is what their contacts look like
this is what iPhones contacts look like

614
01:01:03,899 --> 01:01:07,259
and again you just pick one and you see
everything about that person all the

615
01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:12,899
information you have this is what mail
looks like on these smart phones again

616
01:01:12,899 --> 01:01:19,949
this is what mail looks like on iPhone
you have rich HTML rich text email this

617
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:23,999
is what calendars look like on these
guys that's what calendars look like on

618
01:01:23,999 --> 01:01:28,979
iPhone this is what the web looks like
and we tried to make it look as good as

619
01:01:28,979 --> 01:01:33,929
we could on these it usually looks worse
and this is what you get and of course

620
01:01:33,929 --> 01:01:39,019
this is what you get on iphone and you
can zoom in and see anything you want

621
01:01:39,019 --> 01:01:46,229
and this is what you get from music
players nobody really uses a much and

622
01:01:46,229 --> 01:01:53,639
this is what you get on iphone so after
today I don't think anyone's gonna look

623
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:59,009
at these phones quite the same way again
now let me tell you about some

624
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:03,659
accessories we've got for iPhone got
some great stereo headphones we're going

625
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:08,819
to be shipping and they've got a little
addition to them which is this little

626
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:13,169
thing right over here it's a microphone
and a switch so you can talk you have

627
01:02:13,169 --> 01:02:16,469
them in there you can get a call just
talk the beautiful reception on the

628
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:20,429
microphone and just push it together to
answer a call or hang up on a call and

629
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:24,839
so you can be wearing them and just
dangles right there and picks up your

630
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:30,089
voice beautifully and we also have a
Bluetooth accessory headset that we're

631
01:02:30,089 --> 01:02:34,189
going to be shipping and there it is
right there it's incredibly small and

632
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:38,069
just to let you see what it looks like
it's got one button on the top for

633
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:40,889
answering and hanging up a phone call
you never have to turn it off or on it

634
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:42,440
just goes to sleep
it

635
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,890
we pairs with iPhone so you don't have
to worry about pairing it's really

636
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:51,230
simple and it's very tiny this is what
it looks like in here it's just

637
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,839
beautiful it's the coolest one that
we've ever seen

638
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:59,839
so Bluetooth headset coming as well
battery life there's a lot of stuff a

639
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,859
lot of these phones a lot of these
smartphones have pretty pretty low

640
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:08,390
battery lights we've managed to get five
hours of battery and that's for talktime

641
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:16,339
or video or browsing five hours of
battery life and 16 hours of audio

642
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:23,839
playback so that's dramatically better
than any of these smart phones there's a

643
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:30,829
tremendous amount of high technology in
iphone we've been pushing the state of

644
01:03:30,829 --> 01:03:37,220
the art in every facet of this design so
let me just talk a little bit about it

645
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:43,339
here we've got the multi-touch screen a
first miniaturization more than we've

646
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:53,599
ever done before a lot of custom silicon
tremendous power management OS 10 inside

647
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,180
a mobile device
featherweight precision enclosures 3

648
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:06,530
advanced sensors desktop class
applications and of course the

649
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:12,500
widescreen video iPod we've been
innovating like crazy for the last few

650
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:17,930
years on this and we filed for over 200
patents for all the inventions in iPhone

651
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:21,160
and we intend to protect

652
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:29,300
a lot of high technology I think we're
advancing the state-of-the-art in every

653
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:35,600
aspect of this design so iPhone is like
having your life in your pocket

654
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:43,390
it's the ultimate digital device so what
should we price it at

655
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:51,359
well what do these things normally cost
an iPod the most popular iPod $199 for 4

656
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:57,539
gig Nano what's a smartphone cost well
they they say you get the phone and some

657
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:02,579
of the internet with it although that's
questionable but they cost somewhere

658
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:07,140
between around $2.99 you can get them
for $1.99 pomme just introduced a new

659
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:11,760
one at 399 yesterday so it generally
averaged about $2.99 with a two-year

660
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,380
contract now these phones sort of do
music but nobody uses them for music cuz

661
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,799
they're not very good and so they end up
buying an iPod to go with the phone we

662
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:24,750
know we sell the iPod and so people
spend four hundred and ninety nine

663
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:31,559
dollars on this combination what should
we charge for iPhone because iPhones got

664
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:38,069
a lot more than this stuff right it's
got video real video it's got what this

665
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:44,520
beautiful gorgeous widescreen it's got
multi-touch user interface it's got

666
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:51,329
Wi-Fi it's got a real browser
it's got HTML email it's got Cover Flow

667
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:54,650
and on and on and on and this stuff
would normally cost hundreds of dollars

668
01:05:54,650 --> 01:06:01,950
so how much more than $4.99 should we
price iPhone well we thought long and

669
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:07,410
hard about it because iPhone just does
so much stuff so much better experience

670
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:13,500
on a call and managing your contacts and
visual voicemail random access voicemail

671
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:21,260
for the first time and texting and email
and real browser and Google Maps and

672
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:28,070
tremendous iPod and Cover Flow and video
what should we price this thing at well

673
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:34,200
for for gigabyte model we're gonna price
it at that same $4.99 no premium

674
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:44,910
whatsoever for $99 and we're gonna have
an 8 gigabyte model for just $5.99 so if

675
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:50,130
you're gonna price it starting at 499
dollars now when's it going to be

in June yeah

677
01:06:55,830 --> 01:07:01,170
June we're announcing it today because
with products like this we got to go and

678
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:04,680
get FCC approval which takes a few
months and we thought it'd be better if

679
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,150
we introduced this rather than asked the
FCC introduced to introduce it for us so

680
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:13,650
here we are we're gonna be shipping it
in June in the US we're going to Europe

681
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:20,340
hopefully by the 4th calendar quarter of
this year and Asia in 2008 so Jun in

682
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:26,610
just a few months we'll be shipping in
the US and when we do our partner is

683
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:33,840
going to be singular we've chosen
singular they are they are the best and

684
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:39,390
most popular network in the country 58
million subscribers they are number one

685
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:44,940
and they're going to be our exclusive
partner in the u.s. now it's a unique

686
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,990
partnership though we're not just going
to be selling phones and services

687
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,860
together we're going to be doing
innovation together we worked with

688
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:58,010
singular on visual voicemail because
it's an innovation that requires both

689
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:02,130
innovation on the phone and in the
network you can't do it in just one

690
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,940
place you have to do it in both places
and collaborate and so visual voicemail

691
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:11,070
is the first fruit of this collaboration
and you will see more and when we start

692
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:15,210
shipping in june will be selling iphone
through our own stores and through

693
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:22,830
singular stores and it's my pleasure to
introduce the CEO of singular stand

thank you you know Steve and I first met
about two years ago in New York City

697
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:50,400
when he shared with me this vision that
he had for this product and we've been

698
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:55,019
working on it for some time and actually
entered into a contractual agreement

699
01:08:55,019 --> 01:09:00,269
without us ever seeing the device or the
phone that was because of the confidence

700
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:06,119
that I have it's Steve and his
leadership team to deliver on the vision

701
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:12,630
that they have and every time I see this
it's just wow it's just wow it's really

702
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:17,449
really cool you've exceeded my
expectation

703
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:29,350
it's a real honor for singular to be
partnering with Apple today and I

704
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:33,549
brought with me another company to
celebrate in this and it's a pretty big

705
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:42,520
company it's the new AT&amp;T you know 11
days ago 18 T became a full part

706
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:48,640
I mean senior became a full part of the
new AT&amp;T family and this new family will

707
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:55,870
help fulfill the vision we have of
wireline wireless broadband and video

708
01:09:55,870 --> 01:10:03,030
coming together on one device in the
ways that customers haven't imagined

709
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:09,940
today singular and Apple are truly
raising the bar we're announcing a

710
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:14,260
partnership that the mobile phone
experience takes in the mobile phone

711
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:20,410
experience to a real new level by
bringing together the best network with

712
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:27,330
the best device networks or the
foundation of what singular an AT&amp;T do

713
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:35,050
singular offers the largest digital and
voice data network in America today the

714
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:41,199
singular network has the fewest drop
calls in this country an AT&amp;T is the

715
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:47,350
largest provider of broadband internet
services in this community when it comes

716
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:55,239
to networks 80 wrote the book their
quality is legendary put this network

717
01:10:55,239 --> 01:11:01,449
experience that singular and 80 have and
Apple products together and what do you

718
01:11:01,449 --> 01:11:07,360
get first you get the best voice and
data services with the best user

719
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:14,469
experience available anywhere second you
get real compelling products and

720
01:11:14,469 --> 01:11:20,230
services for example there's a voice
visual voicemail that Steve mentioned

721
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:24,850
which lets you look at the voice message
you want to hear and when you want to

722
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:28,840
hear it as Steve mentioned to create the
visual voicemail

723
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:35,030
it took innovation on singers part at
the network level and by Apple

724
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:40,300
with the device and I promise you'll see
more of that coming down the road

725
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:47,630
third when you bite combine singulars

01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:33,469
this is only the beginning we are just
introducing a new product we're changing

734
01:12:33,469 --> 01:12:41,929
the way companies work together Apple

735
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:48,139

unique relationship that lets Apple be

737
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:04,729

Apple has built a device combining the

738
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:11,050

best that companies they already know
and trust and what they have to offer

742
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:38,599
Apple singular and AT&amp;T have come a long
ways and now we're picking up the pace a

743
01:13:38,599 --> 01:13:45,889
little over six years ago BellSouth and
80 came together to form singular 11

744
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:53,500
days singular joined the new 8

most innovative enjoyable and reliable

746
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:05,470
service in the industry I hope you're as
excited as we are

747
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:10,570
that's what we have to see and enjoy
here this is going to be a terrific ride

748
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:16,020
thank you very much Steve
and congratulations

749
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:32,389
you know as Stan said we started working
together about two years ago and we come

750
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:37,010
from pretty different worlds the
telecommunications industry the computer

751
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:41,199
industry and of course music with the
iPod and and yet we have worked

752
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:45,380
wonderfully together and we love these
guys and we think it's we're gonna bring

753
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:50,929
some great stuff to market over the
years together so let's take a look at

754
01:14:50,929 --> 01:15:03,500
at this market and how big it is
my clickers not working oh there it is

755
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:09,969
maybe it is working so how big is this
market well let's take a look

756
01:15:17,489 --> 01:15:25,280
clicker is not working all right
there's scrambling backstage right now

757
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:43,850
you know when I was in high school Steve
Wozniak and I mostly Steve made this

758
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:48,199
little device called a TV jammer and it
was this it was this little oscillator

759
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:51,650
that put our frequencies that would
screw up the TV and was what have it in

760
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:55,130
this pocket and we go into like a dorm
at Berkeley where he was going to school

761
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:59,239
and a bunch of folks would be watching
like Star Trek and he screw up the TV

762
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:02,480
and somebody go up to fix it and and
just as they had their foot off the

763
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,320
ground he turned it back on if they put
their foot back on the ground he screw

764
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:12,050
up the TV again and within five minutes
he'd to have somebody like this for the

765
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:15,260
rest of the Star Trek episode okay so
maybe it's working now maybe they're

766
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:20,810
gonna have to click them for me so game
consoles 26 million game consoles were

767
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:24,500
sold in 2006 worldwide actually a little
smaller than you'd think

768
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:30,440
it's not such a big market digital
cameras dwarfed it at 94 million mp3

769
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:40,790
players 135 million and PCs about 209
mobile phones just about a billion last

770
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:47,389
year worldwide so what does this tell
you what this tells you is that one

771
01:16:47,389 --> 01:16:53,570
percent market share equals 10 million
units this is a giant market if you just

772
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:58,610
one percent market share you're gonna
sell 10 million phones and this is

773
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:03,170
exactly what we're gonna try to do in
2008 our first full year in the market

774
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:07,550
is grab 1 percent market share and go
from there so we're gonna enter a very

775
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:11,540
competitive market a lot of players we
think we're gonna have the best product

776
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:15,710
in the world and we're gonna go for it
and see if we get one percent market

777
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:25,280
share 10 million units in 2008 and go
from there so today we've added to the

778
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:36,560
Mac and the iPod we've added Apple TV
and now iPhone and you know the Mac is

779
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:42,380
the only one that you really think of as
a computer right and so we thought about

780
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:47,090
this and we thought you know maybe our
name should reflect this a little bit

781
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:50,900
more than it
so we're announcing today we're dropping

782
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,770
the computer from our name and from this
day forward we're going to be known as

783
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:59,890
Apple incorporated to reflect the
product mix that we have today

784
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:12,800
you know I didn't sleep a wink last
night and I was so excited about today

785
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:18,380
because we've been so lucky at Apple
we've had some real revolutionary

786
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,880
products the Mac in 1984 is an
experience that those of us that were

787
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,650
there will never forget and I don't
think the world will forget it either

788
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:33,710
the iPod in 2001 changed everything
about music and we're gonna do it again

789
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:45,530
with the iPhone in 2007 we're very
excited about this you know there's an

790
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:50,300
old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love I
skate to where the puck is going to be

791
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:56,929
not where it has been and we've always
tried to do that at Apple since the very

792
01:18:56,929 --> 01:19:11,789
very beginning and we always will so
thank you very very much
